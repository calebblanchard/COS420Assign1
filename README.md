# COS420 Assignment #1

This is my first assignment for my COS420 - Object-Oriented Design coursework.

I was supplied with starting code that allowed the user to add a generic item to a DAO and exit the program.

From that, I developed an application that could be used by a flower shop to manage customer, inventory and order information.
The app has a simple menu driven interface that allows the user to do the following:

    1. Add a Customer
    2. Display the shop's list of Customers
    3. Add a new Inventory Item
    4. Add some stock to an existing Inventory item
    5. Display the shop's list of Inventory items and how how much of each is in stock
    6. Place an Order for a specific Customer
    7. Display all Orders placed for a given Customer
